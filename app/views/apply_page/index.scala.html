			<p>Hey there, Ilya here, I'm <span style="font-size: 2.8rem;">super psyched</span> to hear that you're interested in applying for the <b>next session</b> of the <b>@utilities.Constants.name.</b></p>
			<p>Hereâ€™s what to expect in this application:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The reason for this application is for me to <b>get to know you</b> and <b>your motivations</b> for wanting to join the @utilities.Constants.name program.</li>
				<li>Rest assured that the <b>information you provide will be kept strictly confidential</b> and will not be shared with anyone.</li>
				<li>Try not to skip questions. While no questions are mandatory (except your name and email address), your application will be much stronger if you try to <b>answer all questions.</b></li>
				<li>Please <b>finish the application in one sitting.</b> It should take you about 10-15 minutes. If you close out of the application or refresh the page before you're done, you will have to start again.</li>
				<li>I guarentee you a <b>response to your application within 24 hours</b> of you completing it.</li>
			</ul>	  
			<h2 class="text-right"><b>Let's get started!</b></h2>
