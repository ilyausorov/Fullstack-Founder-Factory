					("When is the next session of the Fullstack Founder Factory program and how much does it cost?","The next session is from the week starting September 17th until the week ending November 11th (pushed back by 2 weeks from the original timing of beginning the week starting September 3rd until the week ending October 28th. Tuition is $3500 per student."),
					("What toolsets and/or programming languages are being taught?","The content being taught is meant to be language and toolset agnostic - programming employs essentially the same concepts regardless of language or toolset. Languages or tools just make some use cases easier and others more complex. The goal with the program is to teach you to understand how fullstack programming works so that you can do it with any set of tools or languages that you choose to use in the future. However, to get you started we will be focusing on full stack web applications so HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL will all be used to demonstrate the concepts you learn and get you working on your project."),
					("What if I don't have a project idea yet or am not sure I want to be a founder?","Before embarking on the journey of learning to code and going through this program, you should seriously ask yourself if you are ready to devote the time, energy and passion. One very good way of demonstrating that you are will indeed devote the time and energy to this program is by showing your passion for a project that you really want to build. If you're not serious about wanting to build something or becoming a founder, it is highly likely that this program is too early for you. As an additional rule of thumb, if you're not willing to give up a regular activity that you do in your life and replace it with learning to code, then you shouldn't do this program."),
					("What does the application process look like?","After you apply through this website, you will be contacted within 24 hours to set up an interview to discuss the program and for us to get to know you and see if you have a sincere interest in joining the program. You should hear back within a week or sooner from your interview date whether you have been accepted or not. If you are accepted, you will then be required to submit the tuition fee. Failure to submit the tuition fee within 5 days will result in you losing your seat in the program."),
					("What time commitment will I have to make to this program?","You should expect to have at least 15 hours available a week to start working on coding. We will have a 3 hour group session once a week, a 1-1 90 minute session, and 10-12 hours to work on your project at home."),
					("What should I do to make the best of the 8 weeks I have during the program?","Ask lots of questions.  More questions than you've ever asked in your life perhaps. Clarify anything that you don't understand. Make sure that you are solid on the concepts. Both our goal and your goal should be to make you self sufficient in learning coding after you're done with the program. If you leave the class knowing enough about all the concepts to Google up the details, you will be in 100x better shape than someone who doesn't understand most of the concepts, but completely memorized the syntax for a single language. Also, don't procrastinate - you will only get out of this program what you put into it."),
					("What happens if I have a question between classes?","Then you go ahead and ask it on the group's Slack channel. Either the instructor or your fellow class members will help you out in no time."),
					("What specifically is and isn't covered in this program?","To see what is covered, look at the curriculum on the main page. There are indeed some important topics that may be important for building your product that are not covered because they are outside the scope of this program, such as: product and visual design, wireframing, advanced algorithms and machine learning, and algebra and logic. Also, outside of the scope of the program is anything to do with business idea validation, product-market fit or your business model."),
					("What if I miss a class or don't have time to do an individual session in any given week?","There are no make-up classes for the group sessions. However, if you miss an individual session in a given week, you can schedule additional time in the following week to make up the missed time. However, you should review your schedule prior to joining the program to ensure that you will have adequate time to commit to the program."),
					("What happens after the 8 weeks are over?","The group sessions may end, but you should continue working on your project with the same passion and energy that you did during your time in the program. As you continue to gain experience, you should find yourself feeling comfortable looking up new topics and concepts that will grow your knowledge of coding. Lastly, you will have access to the Fullstack Founder Factory alumni network, which will be made of individuals like yourself, who are also working on their projects. While it is certainly best if you are able to be self sufficient, you are also welcome to continue asking questions to your fellow alumni and instructor, who will answer, time permitting."),
					("Is doing this program going to get me a job as a developer?","That's not the point of this program and there is no job placement assistance. If your goal is to get a developer job at a company, then this program will probably not go deep enough into any one topic for you to be immediatly qualified for a developer job. Companies hiring developers generally prefer depth in a single part of the stack over the bredth of knowledge across the entire stack that will be taught in this program. The skills and knowledge taught in this program will be most applicable to you working on your own project and continuing to become a self-sufficient learner of coding."),
					("If I choose to drop out, is the tuition refundable?","No. Consider this before joining the program.")
