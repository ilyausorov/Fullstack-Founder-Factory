<p><B>Dispute Resolution</B></p>
<ol class="a">
    <li>All disputes between FFF and you arising out of or in relation to this Agreement (including any disputes related to the validity, interpretation or enforceability of this arbitration clause) shall be settled by arbitration under the rules of the State of New York (the “Arbitration Rules”).

</p>    
<p><B>Severability</B></p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, FFF shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.</p>
    
<p><B>Non Waiver and Assignment</B></p>
<p>FFF's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. FFF may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Service.</p>

    <p><B>Termination</B></p>
<p>FFF may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to any breach of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, FFF may immediately terminate or suspend accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright infringement.</p>
    
<p>If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by notifying FFF at any time and closing your account for the Service. Your notice should be sent in writing. Termination of the Agreement may result in the immediate deletion of any Content that you have submitted to FFF. FFF will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

    <p><B>Notice</B></p>
<p>Where FFF requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing FFF with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to FFF is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by this Agreement, FFF’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to FFF at the following address: @utilities.Constants.name, LLC, PO Box#713, New York, NY, 10024. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by FFF by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.</p>

    <p><B>Entire Agreement</B></p>
<p>Without prejudice to the provisions expressly set forth herein, this Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and replaces any previous understanding, discussion and/or letter of intent executed by the Parties in relation to such subject matter. Any changes to this agreement must be made in writing and state that it is overriding this agreement, and must be agreed to by both parties.</p>
